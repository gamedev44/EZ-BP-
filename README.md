**Provided By Asterisk @PGD**


#### Introduction
EZ - BP+ is a powerful tool designed to simplify Blueprint scripting in Unreal Engine. 
- It offers a user-friendly interface for creating complex logic graphs efficiently. 

- Here's a Quick Guide on how to Get Started Early and use its features to test:

#### Using EZ BP+ Logic Graph HTML

1. **Searching for Nodes:**
   - In the input field provided, users can search for any node in the database by its corresponding shortened ID or given event name.
   - Once a node is selected, users can see a preview of its functionality and description.

2. **Built-in Events:** Only a FEW SO FAR BUT MANY MORE COMING VERY SOON.
   - EZ BP+ provides three built-in events: "When Level Starts," "Custom Input Action Binding Integration Event Dynamic," and "Custom Prefab Event Code."
   - "When Level Starts" is equivalent to On Event Begin Play. It executes the specified logic when the level begins.
   - "Custom Input Action Binding Integration Event Dynamic" allows users to add key input by selecting "IF Key Pressed" and inputting any desired key or direct string data. This feature provides flexibility in defining key actions.
   - "Custom Prefab Event Code" consists of full series of commented code with nodes, ensuring modularity and ease of use. These prefabs are activated by default but not pinned together, allowing for full modularity with ease.

3. **Node Activation and Deactivation:**
   - All inputs and built-ins are disabled by default, with a disabled message to indicate their inactive state. Users can enable them as needed.
   - Custom prefabs are activated by default but not pinned together, ensuring modularity. Users can easily customize and pin nodes as required.

4. **Code Conversion and Transpilation:**
   - EZ BP+ converts all code provided by the user into nodes. When copied, this code transpiles to serialized Visual Node Based C++ via jQuery. This enables querying data from a dictionary database for translating keywords or sentences into custom C++ Blueprint nodes in serialized data format.
   - Serialized data nodes can be easily copied to UE5 WHich will see it as Blueprint and also integratable into other APIs and systems for improved performance and compatibility.

#### Conclusion
With EZ BP+, users can streamline their Blueprint scripting workflow, create complex logic graphs with ease, and seamlessly integrate custom C++ Blueprint nodes into their projects. Explore the features and unleash the full potential of Unreal Engine development with EZ BP+.
